# optimization_techniques
Repo to hold the interested algorithms and code chunks from BYU ME 575. Mostly for my own benefit and specifically not for use by any students from BYU that have not taken the class.

## Notice
If you are a student taking this class, I would highly recommend not using code from this repo to solve your homework. You will gain much more out of the class if you develop the algorithms yourself. Additionally, this code is not licensed for you to copy.
